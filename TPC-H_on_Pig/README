TPC-H Benchmark
===============
TPC-H is an ad-hoc, decision support benchmark.

http://www.tpc.org/tpch/

Data
===============
The data is generated using the DBGEN software on TPC-H website. See README in the DBGEN install package on details of how to generate the dataset. 

Each table should be put on HDFS under a separate sub-directory.

Scripts
=============
All TPC-H scripts are under queries. Q<x>.poor.pig and Q<x>.poorer.pig were written in our early project and have been rewritten to Q<x>.pig.

Run Benchmark
=============
./run_tpch.sh input_dir output_dir reducers [hadoop_opts]

where:
   input_dir:   The input directory on HDFS
   output_dir:  The output directory on HDFS
   reducers:    The number of reduce tasks to use per MapReduce job
   hadoop_opts: Optional Hadoop options (-conf or -D)

Tip: You can get the tab-separated timings using:
>$ grep "times (sec)" out.log


Run Individual Scripts
======================
${PIG_HOME}/bin/pig $hadoop_opts -param input=<input_dir> -param output=<output_dir> -param reducers=<reducers> -f queries/<script_name>

where:
   input_dir:  The TPC-H input directory on the DFS
   output_dir: The output directory on the DFS
   reducers:   The number of reduce tasks to user per MapReduce job
   <script_name>: One of the Q<X>.pig script in the scripts dir
